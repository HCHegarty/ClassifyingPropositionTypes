Pseudocode for changing splitting comments with multiple sentences into one sentence.

Intention:

read in each line of the dataset file
search through for lines with multiple sentences
if single sentence, add to new dataset with no changes
if multiple sentences, split them into separate lines and add to new dataset to be manually tagged later

Outline:

Read file ("FormattedTrainingDataset.csv")
Write file ("PartiallyUntaggedDataset.csv")

read line from file
if (line contains multiple sentences)
    split at ". "
    for each sentence from split
        if (first sentence)
            append '."\n'
        if (last sentence)
            add '"' to start of sentence and append '\n'
        else
            add '"' to start of sentence and append '."\n'
else
    append '\n'
    write line into file
