"Debt collectors file a large number of default judgments because quite simply consumers do not take action, not because they are unaware of the issue.Usually at the time a lawsuit is filed, a debt collector has attempted to resolve the issue via telephone calls and/or letters.This doesn't even include the efforts the original creditor may have made.A lawsuit is never a first response.It is usually done after numerous and repeated failed efforts to work with a consumer to resolve an outstanding debt.A default judgment is just a further extension of that.Even after we file suit, we may attempt to reach the consumer to resolve the lawsuit prior to judgment being taken.I have seen numerous files where we have spoken to the consumer and told them they can file an answer, and they still don't.In my opinion, default judgments are largely the result of consumer's deliberate uninvolvement with the process, rather than a collector taking deceptive steps.I will state that many states have local rules that if there is no response to a summons and the consumer has defaulted, they do not need to be noticed on a motion for a default judgment.Therefore, the actual entry of the judgment may in fact come as a surprise, despite the summons stating if you don't answer a judgment may be taken.However, an attorney who follows the local rules is not acting deceptively.In order to curb this shock for the consumer who doesn't answer, it wouldn't be bad to require all motions for judgment be served upon the consumer, despite local rules which may require otherwise.I would point out, many default judgment motions are not noticed for motion hour.They may simply be submitted for a ruling without a court hearing.As to the inquiry as to what is required to support a default judgment, this varies court to court and judge to judge.The courts that I have seen require more documentation are largely looking for affidavits of debt, charge off statements and statement showing payments or charges, and the assignment (if the plaintiff is a debt buyer).","fact"
"I would like to see requirements that the consumers are required to provide written notice of any new addresses for the creditor to reach them so in the event the account does go into default, the creditor has current information to attempt to contact the consumer.","value"

"I believe that this practice in already in place in three major ways.","value"

"Many disputes are difficult to investigate because it is unclear what the consumer's dispute actually is.If the consumer is specific enough so that there is a clear item to research, we will do so.However, its a vague dispute such as ""I dispute this debt"" or ""I don't owe this debt"" (which is incredibly common), then we will provide statements or a contract to attempt to address it.The amount of the investigation is largely lead by the amount of detail the consumer relays,and most of it results in us relying on the documentation the creditor provides to resolve the dispute.Sometimes we may need to ask the creditor to research their records for indication of X, Y, or Z,but most the time the dispute isn't that specific.I find in my practice that we will often ask a consumer to provide information to support their dispute (such as proof of payment), but then the consumer does not provide it, and we are stuck in our efforts to investigate further.Requiring only a ""reasonable"" investigation without further definition sounds like a punt to the courts to decide the defintion after a lot of litigation.I think at least a broad definition of obtaining documentation to support the position that consumer owes the debt/amount/and creditor is a good place to start.I would love to see consumers use a form letter prepared by the CFPB which spells out a variety of disputes and helps them articulate the dispute better.I do think one of the toughest hurdles for a collector (and one of the biggest complaints from persons against whom collection efforts are made) is when they get a person that states the debt is not theirs (but someone else's ) with the same name.We do our homework on our end to investigate (we'll attempt to compare the last 4 digits of the social, we may run a skip trace to see if party we contacted lived at the address on the statements, etcand we will provide verification,but in a mobile world investigating that the John Smith you contacted is the same John Smith you are attempting to resolve a debt with can prove tricky.This is especially tricky if there is NEVER indication that we have reached the wrong person.We never wish to contact the wrong party regarding a debt,but it unfortunately happens because consumers don't always relay updated contacted information to creditors and a collector then has to rely upon the best information available to them.Unfortunately, I don't know what the fix is here.Despite the stories to the contrary, it simply is not the intent of any professional and responsible collection agency or firm to attempt collections from a party that does not owe the debt,but this is a hard one to address without good communication from the wrongly contacted party and the collector.","value"
