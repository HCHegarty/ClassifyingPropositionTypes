Hi Christian,

Here’s some of the things we spoke about today, I’ve also attached the tutorial I mentioned. 

Here’s the sklearn links we talked about:

Here’s the page on model selection: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html
Here’s the examples of cross validation - particularly look at stratified cross validation: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html
This is the grid search CV I spoke about - it’s useful for trying different model parameters without having to monitor it too closely: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html
Here’s another tutorial on text in sklearn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html

First I’d try classifiers like Naive Bayes, and Linear-SVC (SVM), and as you’ve already done logistic regression. I’d also play with the different hyperparameter values like C, try values of -10,-1,1,10,100. I’d also look at ngrams (single words, pairs of words, triples of words) and set those too. 


Here’s the link to the flask mega tutorial: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world
If you need to deploy something in computing it’s always worth asking Mahamadou. 

Here’s the link to plotly for drawing graphs in python: https://plotly.com/chart-studio-help/tutorials/
This GitHub repository shows how to create some of them: https://github.com/roryduthie/ArgAn_Backend/blob/main/app/routes.py
Then this one shows how you embed the html in a page (just uses divs): https://github.com/roryduthie/ArgAn/blob/main/app/routes.py

Here’s a web project where I’ve deployed a machine learning model, if you go to app, static, model, you’ll see the pickle file of the model: https://github.com/roryduthie/ArgMine

Finally here’s a couple of links around using Free TPU’s on Colab: 
https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/step-by-step-use-of-google-colab-free-tpu-75f8629492b3
https://towardsdatascience.com/using-tpus-on-google-colab-966239d24573
https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-colab-with-tpu-98e0b4230d9c

(If the townrdsdatascience links ask you to sign up just open them in private browsing)

Hope that helps, and like I say feel free to drop me an email with any problems or questions.

Cheers,
Rory
